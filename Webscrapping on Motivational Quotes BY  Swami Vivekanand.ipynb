What can you expect from men who pass their lives in discussing such momentous questions as these and writing most learned philosophies on them! There is a danger of our religion getting into the kitchen. We are neither Vedantists, most of us now, nor Pauranics, nor Tantrics. We are just \"Don't-touchists\". Our religion is in the kitchen. Our God is the cooking-pot, and our religion is, \"Don't touch me, I am holy\". If this goes on for another century, every one of us will be in a lunatic asylum. It is a sure sign of softening of the brain when the mind cannot grasp the higher problems of life; all originality is lost, the mind has lost all its strength, its activity, and its power of thought, and just tries to go round and round the smallest curve it can find.”\n",

       " '“Talk to yourself at least once in a Day, otherwise you may miss a meeting with an EXCELLENT person in this World.”-Swami Vivekananda',\n",
       " '“But there is yet time to change our ways. Give up all those old discussions, old fights about things which are meaningless, which are nonsensical in their very nature. Think of the last six hundred or seven hundred years of degradation when grown-up men by hundreds have been discussing for years whether we should drink a glass of water with the right hand or the left, whether the hand should be washed three times or four times, whether we should gargle five or six times. What can you expect from men who pass their lives in discussing such momentous questions as these and writing most learned philosophies on them! There is a danger of our religion getting into the kitchen. We are neither Vedantists, most of us now, nor Pauranics, nor Tantrics. We are just \"Don\\'t-touchists\". Our religion is in the kitchen. Our God is the cooking-pot, and our religion is, \"Don\\'t touch me, I am holy\". If this goes on for another century, every one of us will be in a lunatic asylum. It is a sure sign of softening of the brain when the mind cannot grasp the higher problems of life; all originality is lost, the mind has lost all its strength, its activity, and its power of thought, and just tries to go round and round the smallest curve it can find.”-Swami Vivekananda,',\n",
       " '“This universe is the wreckage of the infinite on the shores of the finite.”-Swami Vivekananda',\n",
       " '“Go into your own room and get the Upanishads out of your own Self. You are the greatest book that ever was or ever will be, the infinite depository of all that is. Until the inner teacher opens, all outside teaching is in vain.”-Swami Vivekananda,',\n",
       " '“In modern times this millennial aspiration takes the form of equality--of liberty, equality, and fraternity. This is also fanaticism. True equality has never been and never can be on earth.”-Vivekananda,',\n",
       " \"“I must love Him for love's sake. I cannot trade in love.”-Swami Vivekananda,\",\n",
       " '“Arise, awake, and stop not till the goal is reached. Arise, arise once more, for nothing can be done without renunciation.”-Swami Vivekananda',\n",
       " '“43. By making Samyama on the relation between the Akasha and the body and becoming light as cotton-wool etc., through meditation on them, the yogi goes through the skies. This Akasha is the material of this body; it is only Akasha in a certain form that has become the body. If the Yogi makes a Sanyama on this Akasha material of his body, it acquires the lightness of Akasha, and he can go anywhere through the air. So in the other case also.”-Swami Vivekananda,',\n",
       " '“Those who are constantly attached to Me and worship Me with love — I give that direction to their will by which they come to Me.”-Vivekananda,',\n",
       " '“The cause of all the miseries we have in the world is that men foolishly think pleasure to be the ideal to strive for.”-Swami Vivekananda,',\n",
       " '“We plainly see, therefore, that Bhakti is a series or succession of mental efforts at religious realisation beginning with ordinary worship and ending in a supreme intensity of love for Ishvara.”-Vivekananda,',\n",
       " '“Be unattached. Let things work; let brain centres work, work incessantly, but let not a ripple conquer the mind. Work as if you were a stranger in this land, a sojourner. Work incessantly, but do not bind yourselves. Bondage is terrible. This world is not our habitation. It is only one of the many stages through which we are passing. Remember that great saying of the Sankhya philosophy, \"The whole of nature is for the soul, not the soul for nature.\" The very reason for nature\\'s existence is the education of the soul. Is has no other meaning. It is there because the soul must have knowledge, and through knowledge free itself. If we remember this always, we shall never be attached to nature. We shall know that nature is a book we are to read, and that when we have gained the required knowledge, the book is of no more value to us.”-Swami Vivekananda',\n",
       " '“Man is an infinite circle whose circumference is nowhere, but whose center is located in one spot; and God is an infinite circle whose circumference is nowhere, but whose center is everywhere. He works through all hands, sees through all eyes, walks on all feet, breathes through all bodies, lives in all life, speaks through every mouth, and thinks through every brain. Man can become like God and acquire control over the whole universe if he multiplies infinitely his center of self — consciousness.”-Swami Vivekananada,',\n",
       " '“D esire, ignorance, and inequality this is the trinity of bondage”-Swami Vivekananda,',\n",
       " '“Again, we must consider, religion is a [matter of] growth, not a mass of foolish words.”-Swami Vivekananda,',\n",
       " '“T ruth can be stated in a thousand different ways Yet each one can be true”-Swami Vivekananda,',\n",
       " \"“We want that education by which character is formed, strength of mind is increased, the intellect is expanded, and by which one can stand on one's own feet.”-Swami Vivekananda\",\n",
       " '“Aye, born heir to the infinite thou art,within the heart is the ocean of love,\"give, give away,\" - whoever asks return,his ocean dwindles down to a mere drop.From the highest brahman to the yonder worm,and to the very minutest atom,Everywhere is the same god, the all-love;Friend, offer mind, soul, body, at their feet.These are his manifold forms before thee,rejecting them, where seekest thou for god?who loves all beings, without distinction,he indeed is worshipping best his god. Vivekananda”-Swami Vivekananda,',\n",
